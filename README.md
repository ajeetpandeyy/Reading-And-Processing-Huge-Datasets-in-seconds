Vaex- Reading And Processing Huge Datasets in seconds

What is Vaex?

Vaex is a high performance Python library for lazy Out-of-Core DataFrames (similar to Pandas), to visualize and explore big tabular datasets. It calculates statistics such as mean, sum, count, standard deviation etc, on an N-dimensional grid for more than a billion (10^9) samples/rows per second. Visualization is done using histograms, density plots and 3d volume rendering, allowing interactive exploration of big data.
Vaex uses memory mapping, zero memory copy policy and lazy computations for best performance (no memory wasted).

We can Read And Process Huge Datasets in seconds directly read data from AWS S3 Bucket advantage of S3 buckets that we can put any type of data fromat.

Fast and efficient join with help of Vaex does not copy Metarilised the right table when joining saving gigabytes of memory so sub second of joining on billion rows it is pretty much fast.
